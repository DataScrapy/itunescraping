Hi, I need help with crawling all the podcasts from iTunes Podcasts to excel sheet with various data points. 
 Here's a sample: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G5lui23ihy5Te6Kkx-1r167HxA6-wiu-/view?usp=sharing  
The only condition is to show podcasts that are in English and have published an episode in the last 

Hey,

You need https://podcasts.apple.com/us/genre/podcasts/id26 and listennotes.com.

Please give a sample of 10 entries and give an estimate of number of podcasts in total.
